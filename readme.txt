This plugin automatically converts language accent characters to non-accent characters in filenames when uploading to the media library.

== Description ==

This plugin automatically converts language accent characters in filenames when uploading to the media library. Characters are converted into browser and server friendly, non-accent characters.

= Features =

* Converts accent characters to non-accent, latin equivalents in Swedish, Danish, German, and more.
* Removes special characters like exclamation marks, periods, hashtags, and more.
* Lets you choose if you want to convert only image files, or all file types.
* Makes site and server migrations easier thanks to non-accent character filenames.
* Provides filter hook for developers who want to specify which file types to convert.

= Examples =

* Räksmörgås.jpg → raksmorgas.jpg
* Æblegrød_FTW!.gif → aeblegrod-ftw.gif
* Château de Ferrières.png → chateau-de-ferrieres.png

= Worth noting =

The plugin only converts filenames when the files are being uploaded. It can not convert existing files.

= Filter for developers =

This filter provides developers a way to specify which file types the plugin should convert. This filter overrides the plugin settings on the media settings page. For a complete list of mime types, see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_media_type).

The following example will convert PDF, JPEG and PNG files only:

<pre><code>function my_clean_image_filenames_mime_types() {
	$mime_types = array(
		'application/pdf',
		'image/jpeg',
		'image/png',
	);
	return $mime_types;
}
add_filter( 'clean_image_filenames_mime_types', 'my_clean_image_filenames_mime_types' );</code></pre>
